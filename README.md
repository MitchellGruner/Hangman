# Hangman
A vanilla JavaScript that implements HTML and CSS, as well as the Bootstrap Framework, that allows end-users to guess letters that are located within a randomly picked word from a pre-defined array.  The user can have hints displayed to them, but they all cost the user time - once the time runs out, the game is over.  If the user runs out of lives, the game is over.

Used https://www.randomlists.com/random-words?dup=false&qty=15 in order to generate 150 random words for my array.

Used Simon Suh's Hangman game (https://github.com/simonjsuh/Vanilla-Javascript-Hangman-Game) for the hangman pictures, as well as partial inspiration for displaying the letters
to the user (first hint).
